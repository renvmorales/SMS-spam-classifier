# SMS-spam-classifier

## Introduction
Text mining is commonly used to provide some general description into unustructured data (e.g, single text or multiple 
collected user messages). This operation is important not just for exploratory data analysis purposes, but also when 
performing a preprocesing step required in order to apply a machine learning technique such as a classification algorithm. 
Here a small dataset of SMS messages is analyzed and prepared.
